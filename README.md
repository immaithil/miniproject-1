# miniproject-1
SaandBox link https://j478l.csb.app/
This is the first mini-project which I completed during the 6 month certifiacation programme in Newton School.
This is my sample static portfolio page constructed using HTML and CSS only.
No framework is used in This project.

I only used HTML and CSS because this was the key requirement of that project and at that time I doesnt have wide knowledge of JavaScript, hence I have not included it. 
I will include js in my next project.
I used grid and flexbox property of CSS mostly and haven't used any framework.

This page is fully responsive to all screen sizes. 
There is a saperate CSS file 'phone.css' for this purpose.
This is a sample design hance buttons will not work.
Social icons will move you to my profile page on respective site.

In this project I used orange as my brand colour and used it in whole process.
